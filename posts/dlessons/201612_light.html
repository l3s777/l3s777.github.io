        <h3>The torch and the star</h3>
        <p>Hi! I would like to share this... :)
        </p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          One day exploring even farther than I could see and we managed to end up the exploration somewhere far and quite late!
It was in the middle of the nature! middle of nowhere? maybe‚Ä¶ just walking around a volcano after sunset with no current ‚Äúlight‚Äù to see the way back and also wondering
if we remember the way back.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          ok! We need to find the way back. God help!!! please!!! how should we light our way back and also getting to know the way?
 One good idea: To use what we had! The phone torch to ligth the path. Nice! but first, turned off all notifications, data connection, etc,
 so we can use all the battery on the torch and get to see our steps.
This light in our feet let us go one step at the time and helped us not to fall or stepped somewhere else! ‚Äî>
This reminded me about <i>Psalms 119:105</i> because the Bible (the Word of God) is a light to our feet! and let us see the way where we should go!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          But still, the escenario was too dark to get to see the whole way back! But wait! Oh! Look at that star! It is sooo pretty and shine and big!
          (I had this song on my mind: ‚ÄúI want to see your star, my God, that will show me the way to go!‚Äù).
          So, perfect!!! let‚Äôs head that way, looking up for the direction to the star and watching our steps with the phone‚Äôs torch.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Happy ending! we managed to find the way back to meet our friends and
          no damage because we could watch our steps! Celebration with Chinese food!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I kept thinking... God is not only talking to us through His word (which it is the most important) but also through people, circumstances and the point is‚Ä¶
          watch out your steps with God‚Äôs word and don‚Äôt forget to look up! there might be a star in God‚Äôs sky that will give you
          a better hint about where to go üòâ
